# First Post

This is how you would write your blogs!

I built this using Astro and will host using Vercel.

This got done in **under** 5 minutes!

Now that it is made I can show you how to make some changes!

The one you just saw is on my local machine, I will show you how to push that to the live site!

Let's add some quick changes to the site!

Not bad to have made changes and hosted in under 10 minutes!

Look below for how to make the changes to your live site!
