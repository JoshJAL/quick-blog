I opened up my terminal and ran the following commands:

- cd /Desktop to get into my desktop folder
- npm create astro@latest
- Selected the 'Use blog template' option
- created the project under a folder called 'five-minute-blog' by typing './five-minute-blog' when prompted
- Chose to install the dependencies
- Chose to use TypeScript even though I am not using it and selected strict mode
- Initialized a new git repository

And it was done! I had a blog site ready to go!

I jumped in and deleted some boilerplate code and added my own content. Then jumped into the first-post.md file, deleted what was already there and added some of my own stuff.
It was honestly really easy and anyone can do it. Granted I did not add any styles and this is just what Astro provides and it would take some time (maybe another 30 minutes) to make this site truly your own, but it is a great start!

There are some really simple prerequisites to get started:
- Have a GitHub account
- Have node installed
- Have a text editor (I use VS Code, and it's <u>free</u>)
- Look at a markdown cheatsheet so you can feel comfortable writing your blog posts in markdown
- Look at the Astro docs to see what you can do with Astro if you even want to

I made a video and this website in response to a Twitter post saying that it would take days to write a blog site using custom code and a framework. I wanted to show that it can be done in minutes and that it is not as hard as it seems. I hope this helps you get started on your own blog site! You can view the video [here if you would like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ1n_BYgwtc); it's not very good and there is no sound, but it gets the point across. Below I am going to link to the Astro documentation and a markdown cheatsheet. Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to talk about this or anything else!

I don't want this to come across like I am trying to shut down other ways of accomplishing this goal. There are many tools to create a website and I am just showcasing one of them. Every single way of getting it done is valid and all that matters is that you got it done and no matter how that happens you should be very proud of yourself!
